# Analytics

The AI Insight Dashboard provides powerful analytics capabilities to help you derive insights from your AI system metrics.

## Overview

Analytics tools allow you to go beyond basic monitoring by providing advanced analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive capabilities. These tools help you understand the behavior of your AI systems, identify optimization opportunities, and predict future performance.

## Features

### Trend Analysis

Identify patterns and trends in your metrics over time:

- Automatic trend detection
- Seasonality analysis
- Growth rate calculations
- Anomaly detection

### Comparative Analysis

Compare metrics across different:

- Time periods
- Models
- Environments
- Configurations

### Correlation Analysis

Discover relationships between different metrics:

- Correlation matrices
- Causal analysis
- Factor analysis
- Dependency mapping

### Predictive Analytics

Forecast future metric values based on historical data:

- Time series forecasting
- Performance prediction
- Resource usage projections
- Anomaly prediction

## Using Analytics Tools

### Creating an Analysis

1. Navigate to the Analytics section
2. Select the metrics you want to analyze
3. Choose the type of analysis
4. Configure analysis parameters
5. Run the analysis

### Saving and Sharing Analyses

Save your analyses for future reference or share them with team members:

1. After running an analysis, click "Save"
2. Add a name and description
3. Choose sharing permissions
4. Generate a shareable link or export the analysis

### Scheduling Regular Analyses

Set up recurring analyses to monitor changes over time:

1. Create and save an analysis
2. Click "Schedule"
3. Set the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
4. Configure notification preferences

## Advanced Features

### Custom Queries

For advanced users, custom queries allow direct access to the underlying data:

```sql
-- Example custom query
SELECT model_name, AVG(accuracy) as avg_accuracy, 
       AVG(latency) as avg_latency
FROM metrics
WHERE timestamp > '2025-06-01'
GROUP BY model_name
ORDER BY avg_accuracy DESC;
```

### Integration with Data Science Tools

Export data for use with external data science tools:

- Export to CSV, JSON, or Parquet
- Direct integration with Jupyter notebooks
- Connectivity with Python data science libraries
- R integration for statistical analysis

## Best Practices

- Start with simple analyses and gradually increase complexity
- Focus on metrics that directly impact your business objectives
- Combine multiple analytics approaches for comprehensive insights
- Validate predictions against actual results to improve models
- Regularly review and update your analytics approach
